# Client-Server-Communication-using-Internet-Domain-Sockets

Methodology

● First server code is used to create a channel between client and server by giving input of
valid port number and rest of server address and communication is done using inbuilt
functions.

● Then the port number and address are linked with the client .

● First the server should provide the port number where the server and client can
communicate,the port number should be greater than 1024.

● For the client process we need to provide a hostname also.

● In our program we have given the choice for the user(client) to enter the number of
messages the client wants to write to the server.

● The client and server communicate using internet domain sockets
